# 🧠 DiabetesCare – AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System

**DiabetesCare** is a machine learning-powered application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health parameters. This project leverages Python and scikit-learn to build a predictive model using medical data, aiming to assist in early detection and health awareness.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses a supervised machine learning model trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. By inputting features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin levels, and age, the system returns a prediction: **Diabetic** or **Not Diabetic**. It’s ideal for learning ML basics, health data analysis, and deployment-ready modeling.

## ✅ Key Features

- Predicts diabetes using 8 key medical parameters
- Trained with real-world dataset (PIMA)
- Easy to run and customize (no complex setup)
- Fully written in Python
- Suitable for extension into a web app (Streamlit/Flask)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **scikit-learn** – ML modeling
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – Data handling
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Visualization (optional)
- **Replit** – Development IDE

---

🔮 Future Improvements
Add a web interface using Streamlit or Flask

Deploy as a web app for public access

Enhance model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning

Add visualizations for prediction trends
